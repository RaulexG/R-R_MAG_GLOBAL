        They used to be modern. Now, they’re iconic.

        - Music on the Move

        Before smartphones and wireless earbuds, people used to carry their music in their pockets with a Walkman. These cassette players were small, simple, and super popular. Teenagers used to walk around with headphones on, listening to their favorite tapes. Later, CDs arrived, and people used to switch to Discmans. It wasn’t perfect, if you moved too fast, the music skipped but it felt like magic back then.

        - Games in Your Hands

        Before touchscreens, kids used to play on Game Boys. The graphics were black and white, but the fun was real. Pokémon, Tetris, and Mario were everywhere. Children also used to care for Tamagotchis, tiny digital pets that beeped for food and sleep. If you forgot them, they “died”! Simple games, but full of memories.

        - Photos That Print Themselves

        Today, we take thousands of photos. But in the past, people used to take just one shot with a Polaroid camera. The photo came out of the camera right away, and you could watch it appear. Families used to keep photo albums, not cloud storage. There was no filter, just the moment.
