        Nature can be calm and beautiful, but sometimes it shows its power in surprising ways. People around the world have experienced natural events that changed their lives. These stories tell us about moments when the Earth was moving, the sky was flashing, or the sea was rising.

        In 2015, Hurricane Patricia hit Mexico. It was one of the strongest storms ever recorded. While people were preparing their homes, the wind was blowing hard, and the rain was falling heavily. Trees were bending, and roofs were flying off. Many families were hiding in shelters, hoping to stay safe.

        Another event happened in 1985 in Mexico City. An earthquake shook the ground early in the morning. While people were sleeping, buildings were collapsing, and the streets were cracking. Rescue workers were searching for survivors, and neighbors were helping each other. It was a day of fear and bravery.

        Natural phenomena like hurricanes and earthquakes remind us that we live on a dynamic planet. While we are living our daily lives, nature can surprise us. Itâ€™s important to be prepared and to help one another when these events occur. These stories show the strength of nature and the resilience of people.
